# Non-Invasive-Public-Safety-Detection-System

<strong><ins>Problem Statement:</ins></strong> Even after the COVID-19 situation is under control, various essential preventive measures must be taken as there are high chances of another outbreak or relapse of COVID-19. Hence, there is a need to develop a systematic, accurate system to create a safe public working and leisure environment.

<strong><ins>Proposed Solution:</ins></strong> We are proposing a contactless Non-Invasive Safety Detection System that will assess various parameters to permit only healthy and precautious individuals. Various safety measures like Mask and PPO kit detection can be done according to need and use case. Heath parameters like fever, coughing, runny nose, fatigue, stress, etc., are extracted from the user to decide if any anomaly is found. The user can directly be recommended to visit a nearby clinic/hospital.

Further details and analysis can be viewed in the [Presentation](../main/Infosys%20Summer%20Of%20Ideas-%20IoT32.pdf) and [Video](https://youtu.be/WsN0BN_jXZM). This project has bagged <strong><ins>First Position in Internet of Things segment at the Infosys Summer of Ideas'20</ins></strong>, which had around 1,00,000 Applicants([Certificate](../main/Infosys_Summer_Of_Ideas_Certificate.pdf)).

The overlaying Safety-Detection-Engine has been hosted on Heroku ([https://safety-detection-engine.herokuapp.com/](https://safety-detection-engine.herokuapp.com/)). Refer to the presentation for details related to the model.
